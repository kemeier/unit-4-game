# unit-4-game

Game in which the user is presented with a "Goal" random number and 4 clickable crystals that each have associated hidden random numbers.  The user can discover each crystal's associated number by clicking on it and seeing it's value show up in their score.  The user then tries to add their score using the crystals to equal the random number and not go above it.  At the end of the game the "Goal" random number changes, as do the values for each of the crystals.

I used html, bootstrap, css, javascript and jquery to create this game.
